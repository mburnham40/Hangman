I hope you enjoy trying this hang man game that I wrote for Linux Bash!

In Bash just type the command "ruby hang.rb" and play from there!!

You can save the game and come back to it later, it will custom serialize the data (I decided to try and make my own format for serialization as a challenge instead of using YAML or JSON)
